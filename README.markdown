This is a collection of various [Acorn](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) plugins.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acorn is a great image editor for the Mac from Flying Meat, and you can grab it from here: [http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/)

[Official documentation](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/docs/plugin_documentation.html) on writing plugins is also available, but you might find it easiest to look through the samples.

This repository contains samples written in JSTalk, as well as in Objective-C.  You'll find various examples, as well as code for reading composites of Acorn images, as well as reading the layer information.
