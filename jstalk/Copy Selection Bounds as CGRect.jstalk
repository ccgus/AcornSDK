How to install this plugin:
1) Choose Acorn's Help â–¸ Open Acorn's App Support Folder menu item.
2) Place this script in the Plug-Ins folder (and make sure it ends with .jstalk)
3) Restart Acorn.  The plugin will now show up in the Filter menu.


This filter will copy the current selection bounds (using the canvas coordinates) to the clipboard as a CGRect.

This script uses a private API in Acorn, so it might break in a version that isn't 3.5.
